            <h2>Brief Recommendation</h2>
            <p>For a better reading experience of this documentation, I suggest following each step alongside the code notebook. This allows you to understand how each step is translated into code. Therefore, I took care to document the logic here, while the notebook translates the logic into code. The notebook can be accessed at the following link:</p>

        <section id="business_problem">
            <h2>Business Problem</h2>
            <p>Rossmann is a large pharmacy chain with over 3,000 stores spread across seven countries in Europe. As you can imagine, sales vary greatly from one store to another, and this happens for many reasons: location, proximity to competitors, holidays, time of year, and even the weather can directly influence what people buy.</p>
            <p>Additionally, certain special dates, such as holidays and year-end promotions, create a much higher demand for specific products. With so many variables at play, itâs a major challenge to plan how to stock the stores.</p>
            <p>To help the company handle this scenario and improve inventory management, the CFO of Rossmann wants to predict sales for the next six weeks.</p>
            <p>The big challenge here is how to combine all these data and generate reliable predictions that help the company plan its operations better.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="data_source">
            <h2>Data Source</h2>
            <p>For this case study, the data was sourced from Kaggle. Kaggle is a renowned platform where various companies host competitions by making their data publicly available and reward teams with the best solutions. Below is the link to the data source, which can also be found in the "data" folder on GitHub.</p>

        <section id="proposed_solution">
            <h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
                <p>At first glance, I could indeed calculate the average sales from the last six months of previous years and attempt to project the future months. However, I want to go further. I want to understand which factors influence the sales and be able to predict the sales for the next six weeks with greater accuracy. To do this, I will train regression machine learning algorithms and select the one that has the best balance between its errors.</p>
                <p>The algorithm will essentially be trained on a portion of the data, learning the behavior of that data specifically, the sales. Once it sees new data, it will predict the sales for the upcoming weeks with greater precision because it has already learned the behavior of the sales phenomenon.</p>

            <p>The following are the steps to solve the problem:</p>
        </section>
        
        <section id="step_1">
            <h3>STEP 1: Data Description</h3>
            <p><strong>Why it is important:</strong> First of all, we need to understand the data we have. Knowing what each column represents and how the data was collected is essential to ensure we are handling the information correctly.</p>
            <p><strong>What it aims to solve:</strong> Ensure that all the data is well understood so that we can use it properly in the following steps.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section id="step_2">
            <h3>STEP 2: Feature Engineering</h3>
            <p><strong>Why it is important:</strong> Often, the data we receive is not ready to feed a machine learning model. We need to create new variables or transform the ones we have so that the model can learn in the best possible way.</p>
            <p><strong>What it aims to solve:</strong> Create or adjust features of the data to improve the model's ability to make accurate predictions.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section id="step_3">
            <h3>STEP 3: Feature Filtering</h3>
            <p><strong>Why it is important:</strong> Not all the variables we have in the data are relevant to the problem. Some may even harm the model's performance.</p>
            <p><strong>What it aims to solve:</strong> Eliminate variables that do not contribute to the solution, focusing only on the ones that are really important for the model.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section id="step_4">
            <h3>STEP 4: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h3>
            <p><strong>Why it is important:</strong> It is important to understand the distributions, relationships between variables, and identify potential outliers or patterns that might impact the model building process.</p>
            <p><strong>What it aims to solve:</strong> Gain initial insights about the data, uncover trends, and prepare for modeling in a more informed manner.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section id="step_5">
            <h3>STEP 5: Data Preparation</h3>
            <p><strong>Why it is important:</strong> After the EDA, itâs time to organize the data so that it can be effectively used in the model. This includes normalizing or standardizing variables, among other tasks.</p>
            <p><strong>What it aims to solve:</strong> Organize and clean the data to ensure that the model can work with it seamlessly.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section id="step_6">
            <h3>STEP 6: Feature Selection</h3>
            <p><strong>Why it is important:</strong> Not all attributes are equally important for prediction. Selecting only the most relevant ones can improve model performance and reduce processing time.</p>
            <p><strong>What it aims to solve:</strong> Choose the variables that contribute most to the prediction, ensuring a more efficient and faster model.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section id="step_7">
            <h3>STEP 7: Machine Learning Modeling</h3>
            <p><strong>Why it is important:</strong> Now that we have the data ready, it's time to train a machine learning model. Here, we can test different algorithms and see which one fits our data best.</p>
            <p><strong>What it aims to solve:</strong> Build the initial model that will be used to predict sales. This is our "baseline," i.e., the first version of the model. From this baseline, we will continue to improve the model.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section id="step_8">
            <h3>STEP 8: Hyperparameter Fine Tuning</h3>
            <p><strong>Why it is important:</strong> After running the model, thereâs always room for adjustments. Modifying certain model parameters can greatly improve its performance.</p>
            <p><strong>What it aims to solve:</strong> Adjust the internal settings of the model to improve its predictions and accuracy.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section id="step_9">
            <h3>STEP 9: Scenarios</h3>
            <p><strong>Why it is important:</strong> After training the model, itâs essential to bring it into the real world and meet business needs. Taking this into account, I created two scenarios, a pessimistic and an optimistic one, based on the MAE (Mean Absolute Error). This helps establish error intervals, providing a clear view of how the model might behave in different situations.</p>
            <p><strong>What it aims to solve:</strong> The goal here was to estimate two scenarios based on the Mean Absolute Error (MAE). From this, we defined the error range by calculating the pessimistic scenario (where the error might be higher) and the optimistic scenario (where the error might be lower).</p>
        </section>
        
        <section id="step_10">
            <h3>STEP 10: Deploy</h3>
            <p><strong>Why it is important:</strong> After training and improving the model, itâs time to put it into operation in the real world so that business users can make use of it.</p>
            <p><strong>What it aims to solve:</strong> Deploy the model to predict sales over the next six weeks, helping the Rossmann CFO plan operations more efficiently. To make this more accessible, Iâll deploy the modelâs API through Render and make calls to this model via Telegram's API (however, the modelâs API will be available for any type of call, Postman, Python requests, etc.). This way, the user can simply provide a store number, and the model will return the sales prediction for that specific store.</p>

            <p>In a tabular dataset (data in table format), each column represents a phenomenon and each row contains information about that phenomenon. Therefore, it is very important that the column names are intuitive to facilitate understanding of what each observation indicates. The Rossmann dataset includes the following columns, which we will refer to as attributes from now on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Store:</strong> Unique store identifier</li>
                <li><strong>DayOfWeek:</strong> Day of the week in numerical format</li>
                <li><strong>Date:</strong> Date of the sale</li>
                <li><strong>Sales:</strong> Value of sales on that day</li>
                <li><strong>Customers:</strong> Number of customers on that day</li>
                <li><strong>Open:</strong> Indicator if the store was open or closed (0 = closed, 1 = open)</li>
                <li><strong>Promo:</strong> Indicates if the store had a promotion on that day</li>
                <li><strong>StateHoliday:</strong> Indicates if it was a state holiday. Stores usually close on state holidays. Values: a = public holiday, b = Easter holiday, c = Christmas, 0 = none</li>
                <li><strong>SchoolHoliday:</strong> Indicates if the store was affected by school holidays on that day</li>
                <li><strong>StoreType:</strong> Store types, categorized as: a, b, c, d</li>
                <li><strong>Assortment:</strong> Describes the type of assortment the store has: a = basic, b = extra, c = extended</li>
                <li><strong>CompetitionDistance:</strong> Distance in meters to the nearest competitor</li>
                <li><strong>CompetitionOpenSince[Month/Year]:</strong> gives the approximate year and month of the time the nearest competitor was opened</li>
                <li><strong>Promo:</strong>Indicates whether a store is running a promo on that day.</li>
                <li><strong>Promo2:</strong> Indicates if the store participated in an extended promotion on the day of the sale. Values: 0 = store does not participate, 1 = store participates</li>

            <p>Here, I renamed the columns to the snake_case format. This means that all the words in the column names are in lowercase and separated by underscores (_). I created a list with the old column names and used a function to transform them into the appropriate format. Then, I replaced the old names with the new versions in the dataset, making them easier to read and understand.</p>

            <p>Here, I checked the data types of the columns. I noticed that the "date" column, which was originally an object type, needed to be converted to the datetime64 data type since we're dealing with dates. This is important because when the data is in the correct format, it's easier to perform the right operations on the columns, such as calculating time differences or filtering by date.</p>

This helped me identify where the data is incomplete. This step is crucial because working with incomplete data can affect the analysis results, so I need to make decisions on how to handle these missing values.</p>

For example, in the "competition_distance" column, I replaced the missing values with 200,000, which represents a scenario where there is no competition, as it's a very distant value. For other columns, such as "competition_open_since_month" and "competition_open_since_year," I replaced the missing values based on the date information (like the month and year). The logic for each value replacement is commented in the notebook.</p>

Some columns, which were previously float64 (like "competition_open_since_month" and "promo2_since_week"), were converted to integer type (int64) since these columns represent whole numbers. This is important because keeping the correct data types avoids issues when running the prediction model.</p>

            <h2>1.7 Descriptive Statistical</h2>
            <p>In this part of the code, I separated the numeric and categorical variables. For the numeric variables, I calculated statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, and other important measures. For the categorical variables, I checked the number of categories and the unique values within each category. This helps to understand the data distribution and identify potential patterns or outliers that may exist.</p>

            <p>Here, I performed a detailed analysis of the numeric variables. I calculated statistics such as the mean, median, minimum, maximum, standard deviation, and others. These values help me get a clearer view of how the data is distributed, whether there is significant variability in sales, and where the extreme values (outliers) are located. To calculate these statistics, I applied functions like mean(), std(), and skew() directly on the numeric columns of my DataFrame.</p>

            <h3>1.7.2 Categorical Attributes</h3>
            <p>Now, for the categorical variables, I wanted to see how many unique values existed in each one. That is, if each column had a few or many categories and what those categories were. For this, I used the .unique() function to check all the unique values for each variable. I also used the boxplot to better explore the distribution of categorical variables in relation to sales. The boxplot is a great way to see the data dispersion and quickly identify any outliers (extreme values) within each category. By plotting the boxplot for variables like store_type and assortment, for example, I can see if some stores or product categories have sales much higher or lower than average.</p>

            <p>In this step, I also raised some hypotheses about what could affect the sales.

Sometimes, models find relationships in the data that, when combined, can effectively explain the phenomenon being studiedâin our case, Rossmann store sales. Thus, I created new columns such as year, month, day, and week to capture temporal information. Additionally, I created variables like competition time and promotions to better understand the impact of these factors on sales.

            <p>Cyclical variables, such as <strong>day_of_week</strong>, <strong>month</strong>, and <strong>week_of_year</strong>, were transformed using trigonometric functions (sine and cosine). This is necessary because these variables have a cyclical nature: the day of the week (e.g., Sunday and Monday) is closer to each other, but without the transformation, the model might treat them as distant. Trigonometric functions help to represent this cyclical continuity.</p>

            <p>The idea of splitting the dataset into training and test sets is to ensure the model gets a fair evaluation. The training set is the part of the data used to "teach" the model. That is, the model learns from this data, finds patterns, and adjusts its parameters to make more accurate predictions. The test set, on the other hand, is the part of the data that the model has never seen before and is used to evaluate how it will behave in real-world situations, with data that was not used during the learning phase.</p>

            <p>Boruta is a very effective feature selection algorithm that is based on the Random Forest model. It works by creating "shadow" copies of the original variables and comparing them to identify which ones are truly important for predicting the target. The variables with the highest importance in the model are considered relevant, while those with an importance similar to or lower than the shadow versions are discarded. This process helps reduce the number of variables in the model, focusing only on the most significant ones and removing those that do not contribute to the prediction.</p>

        <h2>STEP 07: Machine Learning Modeling</h2>
        <p>Machine learning (ML) is a field of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn from data and make predictions without being explicitly programmed. By analyzing large volumes of data, the model can identify patterns and relationships between variables, adjusting to predict future outcomes more accurately. This allows the model to learn from examples, becoming more precise as it is fed more data. The goal is to teach the model how to make predictions or classifications, using data to identify trends, and then apply this knowledge to new data that the model has never seen before.</p>
        <p>In this session, I will use some of the most common regression models, such as Lasso, Random Forest Regressor, and XGBoost Regressor. But before that, we need to understand what errors in ML are and what they tell us.</p>
        <p>In the process of building the model, the separation between training data and test data is essential. The training set is used to teach the model, meaning it learns from this data, identifying patterns and adjusting as needed. The test set, on the other hand, is used to evaluate the modelâs ability to generalize, that is, to make good predictions on data it has never seen before. This ensures that the model doesn't just "memorize" the data but learns in a way that can be applied to new scenarios. In my case, I separated the data so that the last six months of sales were used to test the model, while the rest was used for training. This separation helps to measure the accuracy of the model and its ability to generalize to new data.</p>
        <p>Within linear regression models, which are used to predict continuous values, there are some common variations. The simplest model is simple linear regression, which is used when we want to predict a value based on a single independent variable (for example, predicting sales based on just one variable, such as the price of a product). Multiple linear regression, on the other hand, is used when we want to predict a value based on multiple independent variables (such as price, promotions, and number of store visitors, for example). In addition, we also have regularized regression models, like Lasso and Ridge, which help prevent overfitting by adding a penalty to the magnitude of the coefficients, making the model simpler and avoiding excessive adjustments to the training data.</p>

            <h2>What are Errors in ML?</h2>
            <p>In machine learning, errors refer to the difference between the values predicted by the model and the actual observed values. These errors are essential to evaluate how the model is performing and how accurate its predictions are. There are different ways to measure these errors, and the most common ones are <strong>MAE (Mean Absolute Error), MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error), and RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)</strong>.</p>
            <p><strong>MAE</strong> shows the average error without considering the direction, meaning it indicates how much the model is off on average. <strong>MAPE</strong> helps understand the error in percentage terms, being useful when dealing with data that can have large value variations. Finally, <strong>RMSE</strong> is sensitive to large errors, which can be important when we need to give more attention to significant mistakes.</p>

            <h3>MAE (Mean Absolute Error): 12</h3>
            <p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> The value of 12 means that, on average, the sales predictions are off by 12 units from the actual values. This is a relatively simple error to interpret, indicating how far, on average, the modelâs predictions are from the real values, without considering whether the errors are large or small specifically.</p>
        
            <h3>MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error): 8.2%</h3>
            <p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> The MAPE of 8.2% means that, on average, the sales predictions are off by 8.2% in relation to the actual values. In other words, the model is erring by about 8.2% in its predictions. This value is useful because it expresses the error in relative terms.</p>
        
            <h3>RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): 12.65</h3>
            <p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> The RMSE of 12.65 means that, when considering squared errors, the model has an average error of approximately 12.65 units. Since RMSE is more sensitive to large errors, it may be higher than the MAE if there are large errors in the data.</p>
        
            <h3>MPE (Mean Percentage Error): 2.89%</h3>
            <p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> The MPE of 2.89% indicates that, on average, the model overestimates sales by 2.89%. This is important because it shows the direction of the error (whether the model tends to overestimate or underestimate) rather than just showing the magnitude of the error.</p>

            <p>In the Single Performance table, we observe that the Mean Model outperformed more complex models such as XGBoost, Lasso, and Linear Regression in several metrics, such as MAE, MAPE, and RMSE. This is interesting because, at first glance, one might expect that more advanced models, like XGBoost or Random Forest, would outperform the simple mean. However, the Mean Model has a relatively low MAE and a very small MAPE, indicating that it is making predictions quite accurately, although in a simple manner. This performance may suggest that the data is relatively stable or that the sales variation is small, allowing a simple forecast like the mean to be competitive. However, it is important to note that the Mean Model has a higher RMSE, which may indicate that it is sensitive to large errors in some observations, but overall, its errors are not drastic enough to affect the percentage forecasts (MAPE).</p>
        
            <p>On the other hand, Random Forest, which is a more complex model, shows a strong overall performance, with a low MAE and an even lower MAPE, making it superior to other models. XGBoost, although powerful, had elevated MAE and RMSE values, which suggests that it may be making larger errors in some predictions, impacting the absolute error metrics. Lasso and Linear Regression also did not perform well, showing higher errors in both absolute and percentage terms. The underestimation of sales is visible in these models (as indicated by the negative MPE), which may have caused their performance to fall short of expectations compared to the Mean Model.</p>

XGBoost shows mixed results, with a slightly higher MAE than Random Forest but still competitive in percentage terms (MAPE of 0.25%). However, the difference in RMSE between them suggests that Random Forest may be more stable, while XGBoost still makes larger errors. Simpler models like Linear Regression and Lasso continue to show unsatisfactory results, with higher MAEs and RMSEs, indicating that for this dataset, more sophisticated models are better suited.</p>

            <p>Optuna and Random Search are techniques for hyperparameter optimization, but they operate in very different ways and have distinct characteristics. The main difference between them lies in how parameters are explored and adjusted. Random Search is a simple technique where combinations of hyperparameters are randomly selected within a predefined parameter space. The model is trained and evaluated for each chosen combination, and the best parameter set is selected at the end. Random Search is easy to use and does not require complicated implementation. However, it can be inefficient because it does not intelligently explore the parameter space, potentially wasting time and resources by exploring regions where the results are poor. Additionally, since combinations are chosen randomly, the results can vary significantly between runs.</p>
        
            <p>In this session, I will use both Optuna and Random Search for hyperparameter optimization. I will not implement GridSearch, as it requires significant computational power due to the large number of combinations it needs to test. Optuna, on the other hand, is a tool based on Bayesian optimization, which is more efficient than Random Search, as it learns from previous executions and selects more promising parameters. Thus, Optuna is more effective, saving time and resources during the search for the best parameters. However, it requires more setup and has a steeper learning curve. By comparing the two techniques, it will be possible to assess which one offers the best combination of performance and efficiency for my case.</p>
